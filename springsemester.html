     <h2>Amid the Pandemic</h2>
     <p>Xinyi Luo felt secure when she saw her parents from behind the window. Her long journey back home finally came to an end.</p>
     <p>However, most Chinese students at MU are not as lucky as she is. Instead of going back to China, they chose to stay in Columbia.</p>
     <p>As the coronavirus went viral globally, overseas Chinese students are facing a difficult situation. Plenty of campuses have been closed, and classes have moved online. Some universities, such as New York University, which is located in the hard-hit area, have even closed the student residences. Under this kind of circumstances, flocking home has become a trend for Chinese students around the world.</p>
     <p>Nevertheless, most of China’s overseas students are not traveling back. As Ma Zhaoxu, the vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, has said, “Most overseas students still choose to stay in the local area at present.”</p>
     <p>The same is true of Columbia. According to a research study that surveyed 34 Chinese students and scholars from MU, 59% of them are living off campus, including 9% who moved out of their dorms during the pandemic. Those who stay in the dorm total 35%, and only 6% of them went back to China.</p>
     <p>For these Chinese students, whether they choose to stay or leave, they have to go through a long battle.</p>

     <h2>Life off Campus—After Moving Out</h2>
     <p>When things started to get worse in the U.S., Xuan Zhong and her boyfriend Xiaokang Chen moved off campus. Due to the situation in China, Zhong, as well as other Chinese students, realized the severity in advance.</p>
     <p>“My mother had been warning me of the pandemic for many times, and I wanted to find a shelter,” said Zhong. In her opinion, staying in community-style dorm rooms is dangerous because she would have to be in contact with a lot of people. After moving to an apartment outside, they could have more private space.</p>
     <p>Zhong has been doing a good job on her prevention work. She hasn’t gone out for two weeks, except for fetching the package. Zhong and her boyfriend purchase food from online groceries and cooked by themselves. In their spare time, they formed their own team and played mobile games together. She even began to like her stay-at-home life.</p>
     <p>“My girlfriend really has foresight,” said Chen, referring to their moving out.</p>
     <h2>Staying in the dorm—Consolidation Efforts</h2>
     <p>MU Residential Life has made a consolidation for all students staying in the dorm to reduce the risk of infection. Students were reassigned to suite-style rooms for the better conduct of social distancing.</p>
     <p>“Consolidating is beneficial to us since we don’t need to go to community bathrooms anymore,” said Xin Shu, who has moved to College Avenue from Hawthorn Hall. “The process of moving is tiring though.”</p>
     <p>When asked about the reason to stay in the dorm, Shu said that it was more convenient to live in the dorm on campus. Additionally, all of her friends chose to stay.</p>

     <h2>The Long Way Back Home</h2>
     <p>As Xinyi Luo’s journey back home finally ended, her 14-day quarantine life began. After seeing her parents from afar, she had to follow the staff at the airport to her designated hotel by taking the special car for transferring people who traveled back to their home country like she did.</p>
     <p>The long way back home was exhausting, with a high risk of getting infected on the plane. According to the Consulate-General of the People’s Republic of China in Chicago, long-distance travel will bring a lot of uncertainty amid the pandemic, and minimizing long-distance travel is recommended.</p>
     <p>Possible travel ban in the future is another concern for Chinese students. Time difference and the 14-day quarantine may also cause trouble.</p>
     <p>“At first, I was worried about returning to China,” said Luo. “However, when I saw the uniform of the flight attendants which writes ‘welcome home’ on the back, I really felt safe and warm.”</p>
     <p>The prevention work has been strictly conducted along the way from America to her designated hotel room. Luo cannot get out of her room during the quarantine and needs to live under close attention of the doctors. She has finished the test for COVID-19 and is still undergoing the daily body temperature detection.</p>
     <p>“I feel that I am no longer fighting by myself but fighting together with my people,” said Luo. “They are really doing a great job on epidemic prevention.”</p>
     <p>Though Luo cannot leave the hotel room for 14 days, life is still enjoyable for her. She can order whatever food she likes from takeaways, and hotel staff will drop the order outside her room. There are problems, too. Due to the time difference, she sometimes needs to attend classes late at night and study until 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. Besides, the possible travel ban may lead to the delay of her graduation, which Luo personally does not mind.</p>
     <p>“It’s not easy to come back, but it is worthwhile,” said Luo.</p>
     <h2>Compatriots’ Support</h2>
     <p>Although most of the Chinese students at MU chose to stay, they can still get support from their compatriots.</p>
     <p>One aid provider is their family in China. However, due to the freight restriction, they may not receive their supplies.</p>
     <p>“My parents and Xiaokang’s parents sent masks and protective clothing respectively to us,” said Zhong. “Xiaokang received his package, but mine is still being held in China.”</p>
     <p>In consideration of the problem, Chinese government has sent health kits which contain masks, gloves, disinfectant wipes and medicine to overseas Chinese students.</p>

     <p>The Consulate-General of the People’s Republic of China in Chicago is responsible for the distribution of health kits in its consular district including Missouri, and it has contacted local associations of Chinese students and scholars to give out the kits.</p>
     <p>“We are preparing for the distribution these days,” said Yiteng Zhang, the newly elected president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at MU. “The number of health kits is limited, but we will try our best to let more Chinese students and scholars get the kits.”</p>
     <p>Zhang hopes that Chinese students and scholars do not panic, for CSSA will serve the students as much as possible.</p>
     <p>“The consulate and CSSA are always with you,” said Zhang.</p>
